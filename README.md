# palreport
Lists sizes of the functions in a listing file from Palbart (PDP-8)

## Usage
Each function in the source needs to have its start and end marked by a
comment line.  The start marker is /[ and the end marker is /]

As can be seen in the example below it is rather unintrusive in the code:

```
//
// Output the data in AC to the TTY and wait for the TTY
// to become ready again. Clears AC and L before returning
//
// Inputs: 	AC
// Modifies: 	AC,L
/[
ChrOut,	0 
	TLS		/ Send to TTY
	TSF		/ Wait for TTY to become ready
	JMP	.-1
	CLA CLL		/ Clear AC and L
	JMP I	ChrOut
/]
```

To run the script just pipe in the XXX.lst -file generated by palbar into
the script like `./palreport.sh < mycode.lst`

## Sample output

The output looks like this. Eash line has the starting address of the
function, followed by the function name and the length in (decimal) of the
function. If there's some unused space between this function and the next
that will be reported as "..followed by..."
